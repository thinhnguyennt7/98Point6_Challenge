98 Point 6 Drop Token Game Challenge:

Description:
	Implement a command line program that allows two people to play a game of 9dt, or 98point6 drop token.
	This should allow the players to alternate turns, tell a player that they won with the last move, and print out the board on demand.

Game Rule:
	+ Place on a 4x4 grid
	+ A Token dropped along a column (labeled 1-4) and token goes to the lowest unoccupied row of the board.
	+ Player wins when they have 4 tokens next to each other either along a row, in a column, or on a diagonal.
	+ Players draw if the board is filled, and nobody has won then the game is a draw.
	+ Each player takes turn, starting with player 1, until the game reaches either win or draw.
	+ If the player tried to put a toke in a column that is already full, that result in an error state, and the player must play again until the play valid move.

Commands:
	+ PUT <column> -> OK | ERROR | WIN | DRAW
	+ GET -> List of columns that have been successfully put to
	+ BOARD -> A 4x4 matrix that shows the board state
	+ EXIT -> Ends the program
Where 0 is unfilled, 1 is player 1, and 2 is player 2.
